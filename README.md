## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (only requirement on your host machine)
- Git

### Installation

#### Quick Run - Existing Installation

Code below will install all necessary dependencies and set up the development environment.
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:matthewdeaves/willow.git
cd willow/

# Run the setup script
./setup_dev_env.sh
```




> Note: 
> This assumes that you have already run `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d` to start the containers and that docker compose is set up correctly.

#### Quick Run - Fresh Installation

1) Install docker
2) Clone repo
3) cd into folder
4) `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d`
5) Wait for the containers to be fully up and running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:matthewdeaves/willow.git
cd willow/

# Test Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check if the containers are running
docker-compose ps
```


ðŸŽ‰ **That's it!** Your development environment is ready:

- **Main Site**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:8080/admin](http://localhost:8080/admin)
  - **Login**: `admin@test.com` / `password`

### Additional Services

- **phpMyAdmin**: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) (root/password)
- **Mailpit**: [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) (email testing)
- **Redis Commander**: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) (root/password)
- **Jenkins**: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) (start with `./setup_dev_env.sh --jenkins`)

## Managing the Application

## Using `manage.sh`

`manage.sh` is a script that can be used that simplifies common tasks needed to manage the application.

This contains predefined commands for common tasks. Use `./manage.sh <command>` to run a command (or just `./manage.sh` to see a list of available commands).

## Using script aliases from `setup_dev_aliases.sh`

Ensure you have sourced the `setup_dev_aliases.sh` 
and have added the necessary details needed in your specific .*rc file. Then run:
```bash
source ./setup_dev_aliases.sh
```
You should now be able to use the defined aliases in your terminal session, look at 'dev_aliases.txt' for more information on what aliases are available.

### Useful Aliases
Once you have setup aliases, you can use them to run commands in the project container more easily. 
Here are the following aliases that would help manage the project:

#### Project Management Aliases

- Get a bash shell in the main project container
```bash
willowcms_shell
```

#### CakePHP Command Aliases
- run project-specific cakephp commands
```bash
willow_shell 
```


> Note:
> - All cakephp commands should be run inside the project container unless pre-pending `willow_shell`
> - running `willow_shell` is the equivalent as running `bin/cake` inside the container. Therefore, you can use `willow_shell` to run any cakephp command without having to enter the container manually.

### Using the Project Container

1) Get into the main project container using `docker-compose exec [NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTAINER] /bin/bash` (or alias `willowcms_shell` after setting up aliases)
2) Once in the container, run `bin/cake migrations migrate` to migrate the DB just like you would in a normal cakephp setup
3) Terminal in the container and run `bin/cake migrations seed` to seed the DB 

> Note: The project doesn't contain any initial seed data as all seeding is already managed through commands in the `manage.sh` scripts. You will need to create your own seed files in the `config/Seeds` directory if you plan on using the seeding functionality according to the CakePHP documentation.
