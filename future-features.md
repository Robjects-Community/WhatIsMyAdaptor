# Missing Pages

## developing the server cost and about pages pages

- [ ] compare and contrast costs of developing server (focus on that it costs zero dollars, minus the api ai and the prompts used to assist in code generation)

## publishing the page and deploying

compare and contrast services looked into but either too confusing for it to make sense for actual production use

- [ ] portainer
- [ ] digital ocean (droplet, kubernetes, etc., )
- [ ] jenkins
- [ ] kubernetes
- [ ] helm
- [ ] kind
- [ ] rehd hat open shift
- [ ] docker compose
- [ ] docker build
- [ ] aws integration
- [ ] github deployment
- [ ]

## actual features still need to be donw

- [ ] search function to look into products
- [ ] not-essential: search function to look at every entity in the web app
- [ ] implementation of inserting links and documents and having the ai document processor make a product and keep a verification score

## fix

- [] fix code imports
- [] fix form admin for quiz form routes /admin/product/forms
-
