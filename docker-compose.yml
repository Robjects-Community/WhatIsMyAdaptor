# This docker-compose file is used to set up a CakePHP 5 application with a backend service, PostgreSQL database, Redis cache, Adminer for database management, and Jupyter Notebook for data science tasks.
# It includes health checks for the backend and database services, and sets resource limits for each service to ensure efficient resource usage.
# The services are configured to run with specific user permissions and security options to enhance security.
# The frontend service runs a CakePHP 5 application, while the backend service runs a Node.js application.
# The database service uses PostgreSQL, and Redis is used for caching.
